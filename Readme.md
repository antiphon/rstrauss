# rstrauss: R-package for simulating and fitting Strauss point pattern model in 2- and 3-dimensions (2D, 3D)
Simulate and fits the stationary and isotropic Strauss point process in 2- or 3-dimensional cube (rectangular cuboid). 

Implements standard simulation algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings, birth-and-death and dominated CFTP.

Implements the maximum logistic likelihood estimation method and direct numerical maximum likelihood estimation using approximations of the normalizing constant.
